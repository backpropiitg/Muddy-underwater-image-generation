## Underwater Muddy Image Generation using fine-tuned StableDiffusionXL model

- The simulation of underwater environments with high turbidity is crucial for developing and testing image processing and computer vision algorithms. However, obtaining real-world muddy underwater images can be challenging due to logistical and environmental constraints. In this work, we present a novel method for generating synthetic muddy underwater images using a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) model. By training SDXL on a dataset of underwater scenes with varying levels of murkiness and particle density, we produce realistic images that emulate the challenging conditions of underwater environments with limited visibility. This synthetic dataset provides a valuable resource for researchers developing and testing algorithms for underwater exploration, navigation, and analysis under adverse visibility conditions.
