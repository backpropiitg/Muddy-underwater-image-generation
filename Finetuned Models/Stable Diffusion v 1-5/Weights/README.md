## Getting the following weights and tokenizer files

#### Download the following files from the official hugging face directory 

- Since we were not able to train the model, given the resource constraints, we have downloaded the official checkpoints for the Stable diffusion v 1.5 model from https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main and save it in the data folder

- We also need to download the files that would be needed for tokenizer. Download vocab.json and merges.txt from https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5/tree/main/tokenizer and save them in the data folder
